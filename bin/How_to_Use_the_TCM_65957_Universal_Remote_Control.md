## Programming the TCM 65957 with Codes
 
The TCM 65957 comes with a manual that contains a list of codes for different devices. You can use these codes to program the remote control to operate your devices. Here are the steps to follow:

3. Press the device button (TV, DVD, VCR, SAT) that corresponds to your device.
4. Enter the four-digit code for your device from the manual. The LED indicator will flash twice if the code is correct, or once if it is wrong.
